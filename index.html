            <p>Hi, I’m Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a maker of things. I appreciate simple stuff and sometimes complex gadgetry (when they work well).</p>
            <p>In the past I have made many small illustrations, I have dabbled in 3D printing, 3D modeling, programming and content creation (see example below):</p>

            <p>When exploring YOUTUBE, I decided to try upload the above video to test how YOUTUBE uploading works.</p>
            <p>I think I am capable with SVG and “OK” at Pixel art When I was little I used to draw wild eyed creatures</p>
            <p>Now I many draw scribbles and have a hard time sticking with a drawing to the point of a work that interests me.</p>
            <p>In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polka dotted knowledge on programming and incorporate my Illustration and design skills while learning to make something cool.</p>
            <p>I’m looking forward to making many more gadgets, designs and illustrations.</p>

            <p>Pls Ramble on… Previous knowledge that I have gained that I feel will help me in this unit include The Cert III in Information Digital Media &amp; Technology that I took at Townsville tafe in which I worked with computers. Installing operating systems and managing a simple network of ~3 virtual machines.</p>
            <p>During highschool as part of a yr.12 for the Design and Technology project I worked with multiple 3d printers and in multiple makerspaces, namely the Hackerspace in Kuranda which is now closed, a makerspace in sydney and a makerspace at a student study building in Brisbane. Even before this project I had an interest in 3d printers and fabrication, the experience of working with these machines and in these coworking spaces.</p>
            <p>As part of Visual Design in highschool I worked with photoshop and similar software, learning about white space and other design elements. I think this relates to my creative practice as a game developer, as appeal in games are very dependent on their visual and interactive design elements.</p>
            <p>Maths Physics I also did maths and physics in highschool</p>
            <h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Mindstorm classes with CSIRO</li>
            <li>I’ve been involved with various maker spaces alone the East Coast of Australia</li>
            <li>I’ve traveled extensively throughout Australia and have had journeyed around the world. Previously visiting 11 different countries.</li>

            <p>while trying to get the <code>unity-2020.2.2f</code> version for linux from the unity download archive the link wasn’t opening UnityHub</p>
            <p>I fixed this by running unityhub from the commandline with the archive link I copied from the Unity archive:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>$ unityhub unityhub://2020.2.2f1/068178b99f32</code></pre>
            <p>later I found out that I needed a package called xdg-utils for my version of linux to open specific urls in exteral applications</p>
            <p>this problem occured because the computer I work on is running archlinux which is known to be built the ground up and uses the KISS philosophy (Keep It Simple Silly) to maintain a clean developement environment for more technical computer users.</p>
