# Post a brief introduction about yourself and what you hope to gain out of the subject.
Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a maker of
things. I appreciate simple stuff and sometimes complex gadgetry
(when they work well).

In the past I have made many small illustrations, I have dabbled in 3D printing,
3D modeling, programming and content creation (see example below):

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="1280" height="864" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_pksmsTEmQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

When exploring YOUTUBE, I decided to try upload the above video to test how
YOUTUBE uploading works.

I think I am capable with SVG and “OK” at Pixel art When I was little I used to
draw wild eyed creatures

Now I many draw scribbles and have a hard time sticking with a drawing to the
point of a work that interests me.

In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polka dotted knowledge on
programming and incorporate my Illustration and design skills while learning to
make something cool.

I'm looking forward to making many more gadgets, designs and illustrations.
