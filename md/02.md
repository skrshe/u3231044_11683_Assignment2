# Discuss your experience with the Australian Games Industry.
Games I know of made in Australia are
Jetpack Joyride
Hollow Knight
Antichamber

**Report**
My experience with the Australian Games Industry only really pertains to Halfbrick’s ‘Jetpack Joyride’  and ‘Fruit Ninja’. I’ve only recently played a game developed inside of this great southern land and that is ‘Hollow Knight’ developed  by Team Cherry, which is a true joy to play.

**Relate**
Australia’s games industry is made up of dozens of small studios, concentrated primarily in Victoria. The Interactive Games & Entertainment Association IGEA (Sydney Morning Herald)  February 2, 2021)
