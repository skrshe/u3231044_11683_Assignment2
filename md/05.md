while trying to get the `unity-2020.2.2f` version for linux from the unity
download archive the link wasn't opening UnityHub

I fixed this by running unityhub from the commandline with the archive link I
copied from the Unity archive:
```console
$ unityhub unityhub://2020.2.2f1/068178b99f32
```

later I found out that I needed a package called xdg-utils for my version of
linux to open specific urls in exteral applications

this problem occured because the computer I work on is running archlinux which
is known to be built the ground up and uses the KISS philosophy (Keep It Simple
Silly) to maintain a clean developement environment for more technical computer
users.
